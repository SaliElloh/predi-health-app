<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project:

### Background Terminology: 


### Introduction:

In America alone, 12 million people are impacted by misdiagnosis errors. This can be caused by human error, outdated treatment practices, or a knowledge gap between a patient and their doctor. Doctors may prescribe medication or advise patients without having knowledge of their daily routines, leading to uncertainty about whether their instructions have been followed.

Fortunately, 84% of Americans own smartphones and 45% regularly use smartwatches like Apple Watches and Fitbits, which can provide unique insights into a user's health data. Our team recognized the potential of this data to improve the diagnostic process in America and beyond. This led us to create Predi, a live diagnostics and predictive app that aims to bridge the gap between doctors and their patients.

The app offers three main functions to enhance communication between patients and their doctors. 

1. It provides real-time reporting of health-related data, including Fitbit data and user search queries, directly to the patient's doctor.
2. Users can search the app for any symptoms they are experiencing, and the app can report these searches to the doctor with informed guesses on potential causes.
3. The app can track the user's Fitbit health data to identify any trends or information in their health records that may not be immediately apparent to their doctor.

### How is it different?

Predi sets itself apart from current technology in several key ways. First, it offers a more personalized approach to symptom identification. While traditional methods rely on manual input of symptoms into a search bar, Predi leverages user search queries and Fitbit data to make more informed decisions about what a user might be experiencing.

Second, Predi is highly accessible and affordable. Users only need a smartphone and smartwatch to record, monitor, and report their health data, eliminating the need for expensive or complicated technologies.

Third, while the accuracy of data collected by smartwatches may vary, Predi's continuous monitoring and analysis of a user's health data helps bridge the knowledge gap between patients and doctors, providing doctors with a more comprehensive understanding of their patients' health status over time.

Finally, Predi's reporting system is designed to allow doctors to access and verify patient data. Unlike other apps that simply make guesses about a user's symptoms, Predi enables doctors to review and confirm the app's findings, providing a more reliable and trustworthy source of health information.

<b> Group of people it serves: </b>

1. Doctors who want a more comprehensive understanding of their patients' health and a faster, more accurate diagnosis of their conditions.
2. Regular users who wish to monitor their health continuously and receive prompt assistance for any health-related issues they may encounter.
3. Regular users who aim to establish a connection with their doctor outside of the hospital.

### Algorithm explained:


## Getting Started:

To get the project running, there's a few programs and steps needed.

### Built With:

* Python: the primary programming language used for the backend development of the app
* Flask: a lightweight web framework used for developing the RESTful API 
* TensorFlow: an open-source machine learning framework used for building the predictive model 
* Keras: a high-level neural networks API used for building and training the predictive model 
* SQLite: a lightweight relational database management system used for storing user data and health records 
* React Native: a cross-platform mobile application framework used for developing the frontend of the app 
* Expo: a set of tools and services used for building, deploying, and managing the React Native app
* Fitbit API: an API used for collecting health data from the user's Fitbit device
* Google Cloud Platform: a cloud computing platform used for hosting the app and storing user data

### Prerequisites:

1. A C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang should be installed on your system.
2. A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to edit and run the code. Ex: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Code::Blocks.
3. The standard C++ library should be available on your system, since the code uses C++ library headers,  which include <limits>, <vector>, <iostream>, and <fstream>.
